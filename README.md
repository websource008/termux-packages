# Termux packages for the Google Play build of Termux

This repository contains the packages used in the [Termux build on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en).

It's currently mostly interesting if you are a developer looking into the changes necessary to make Termux compatible with the Google Play requirements.

Otherwise, please work on [https://github.com/termux/termux-packages](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages) instead - this repository regularly merges in changes from there (but generic package changes are also welcome here, in which they case they will be merged to `termux/termux-packages` as well).

See https://github.com/termux-play-store for more information, status and updates regarding Termux on Google Play.

## Quick guide to how to build a package
Most developers should use a prebuilt docker image to get a correctly configured and isolated build environment. Start with:

```sh
./scripts/run-docker.sh
```

Now build a package with:

```sh
./build-package.sh -i <package-name>
```

where `<package-name>` is a package name, corresponding to a directory `packages/<package-name/` (so `bash` and `vim` are examples of package names).

## Quick guide to how to develop and patch a package
There are mainly two parts to iterating on a package:

1. Edit the `packages/<package-name/build.sh` build script and run builds iteratively as above.
2. Update package patches and run builds iteratively as above.

Patches are applied from `packages/<package-name/*.patch` files.

Once there is an existing build, a built `.deb` file will be created in the `output/` directory, as in `output/bash_5.2.26-2_aarch64.deb`. Transfer that to your device and install with `dpkg -i output/bash_5.2.26-2_aarch64.deb`.
